 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Alessndro's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I've always had a keen interest in business, entrepreneurship, and the world of technology. While pursuing my studies in business administration and later earning my Master's degree in Entrepreneurship, I couldn't help but be drawn to the endless possibilities that technology and programming offered.

My first real interaction with coding happened during my time at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), where I embarked on a minor in Programming. After graduating with my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I decided to take a brief hiatus from studying to explore the world and immerse myself in different cultures. I spent an incredible 8 months traveling through Asia, soaking in the sights, sounds, and inspirations from all corners of the globe.

During my travels, I realized that my passion for coding and web development was still very much alive and that I wanted to pursue it further. The dynamic world of front-end web development, in particular, captured my imagination.
And so, I returned from my adventures in Asia with a renewed sense of purpose. I embarked on a journey to learn and master front-end web development.
